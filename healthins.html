        medical emergency arises. It is a contract between a policyholder and the insurance company which 
        covers medical expenses that might occur due to illness, injury or accident. If you have a health

    <h2>
        Kind Of Health Insurance Policies
    </h2>

    <p id="p1">
        There are basically two kinds of health insurance policies such as individual or self-plan and family 
        floater policy. As the name suggests, individual policy would only provide coverage and benefits to 
        the main policyholder. On the other hand, in case of a family floater plan, there is only one plan 
        which provides coverage to your entire family such as spouse, dependent children, parent and 
        parent-in-laws or dependent siblings.
    </p>

    <p id="p1">
        One should select the plan, depending upon the factors such as your age, family medical history, 
        children’s age, medical history and of course one’s budget.  Let’s understand about each of these 
        plans in detail:
    </p>

    <h3>
        Individual or Self Health Insurance Plan
    </h3>

    <p id="p1">
        An individual health insurance policy is issued under the name of a single policyholder, which means
        that the sum insured coverage and the benefits of the policy is totally dedicated to the insured and
        covers no one else. Here, the individual purchases the policy to maintain their own health which in
        turn provides financial help in case of their own medical emergency.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Family Floater Health Insurance Plan
    </h3>

    <p id="p1">
        Family floater policy is one policy which aims to provide sum insured coverage to individual and as 
        well his family members. Rather than taking a single policy for each member of the family, the family
        health insurance plan is a better option, as it acts as an umbrella for the entire family. Here the 
        sum assured coverage is shared by all the members who have been covered under the same plan. 
    </p>

    <p id="p1">
        However, it is advisable to have a separate plan for your senior citizen parent or parent-in-laws as 
        it will prove to be a more affordable option. Similarly, if any member in the family has a huge medical
         history, then it is also better to buy a separate plan for them rather than covering them in the 
         family floater plan.
